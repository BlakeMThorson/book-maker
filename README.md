# What is book maker?
it takes any number of text files and combines them together into a single corpus for Markovify, it will then generate a thousand pieces of text that can be anywhere from a sentence to a paragraph. It will then take those pices of text and combine them into a single document in the style of Clement's "The Trouble With Being Born"

# To make a new book
take text files from project gutenberg, throw them all in unread, and run the script. Then your new book will appear in the main folder, and the text files will be moved over to read.

# How Does It Work?
It uses Markovify and spaCy to create more complete sentences in seconds.
